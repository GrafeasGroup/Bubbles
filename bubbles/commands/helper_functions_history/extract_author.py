    """
    Function that determines the user that has reacted to a new user message. The
    reaction list is stored in message_data["reactions"]
    Example of the retrieved reaction list:
        [{'name': 'think-rotate', 'users': ['U4QEPLK6D', 'UE3VDJ002', 'U7T7G5GT0', 
        'UK98SNKCK', 'U01AL41499D'], 'count': 5}, {'name': 'discord', 'users': 
        ['UE3VDJ002'], 'count': 1}, {'name': 'heavy_check_mark', 'users': 
        ['UEEMDNC0K'], 'count': 1}]
    
    good_reactions is a list containing the names of the reactions to test.
    
    If message["reactions"] does not exist (or if message["reactions"] does not
    contain any of the good_reactions reactions), then the output is "Nobody". 
    If only one person has reacted with only one of the good_reactions reactions,
    then the function returns the name stored in the 'users' key. Otherwise, the
    function returns "Conflict".
    
    OVERRIDE CASES: the function will return "Abandoned" if :x: is stored as reaction,
    and "Banned" if :banhammer: is stored as reaction.
